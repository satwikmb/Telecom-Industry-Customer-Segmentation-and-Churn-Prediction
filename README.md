# Telecom Industry Customer Segmentation and Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation and developing a churn prediction model for the telecom industry. The objective is to predict customer churn, forecast monthly revenue, and anticipate overage minutes using machine learning models. The project utilizes the **Cell2Cell dataset** and explores various predictive features, including customer demographics, usage patterns, and service interactions.

## Key Features
- **Churn Prediction**: Developed a model using Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a customer is likely to churn.
- **Monthly Revenue Forecasting**: Built a Random Forest Regressor model to forecast the monthly revenue for each customer.
- **Overage Minutes Prediction**: Created a model to predict when customers exceed their allocated plan minutes.

## Models Used
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Used for predicting customer churn with an accuracy of 62.48%.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Used for monthly revenue and overage minutes prediction with respective RMSE values of 8.538 and 52.58.

## Data Exploration
- Dataset sourced from Teradata center for customer relationship management at Duke University.
- 51,047 customer records with 58 features, including billing, demographics, and usage statistics.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data manipulation and machine learning.
- **Apache Spark**: For handling large datasets and model training.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Random Forest Classifier and Regressor.

## File Structure
- **Churn Project PPT.pdf**: Presentation slides summarizing the project goals, data exploration, and model results.
- **Final Report.pdf**: Detailed project report covering methodology, results, and conclusions.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to explore the models and predictions.
